# This workflow runs once per day and recreates the Flock master, beta, and
# stable branches with the latest history from Flutter.
#
# The Flock branches are reconstituted by taking the most recent history of
# Flutter's branches, and then replaying all of Flock's changes on top.
# This replay is effectively a rebase, but each change is saved in a patch
# file instead of the git log.
